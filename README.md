# NecroBotInstanceCreator
A program to create as many as you want folders with necrobot inside.

Put accounts and password in the richTextBox like this:

acc:pass , ONE PER LINE.

Browse necrobot folder with Browse button.
Click on "copy".
Folders are created with names: "1", "2", "3", ...

And don't touch the auth.json near the .exe. The program needs it.

Enjoy :)
